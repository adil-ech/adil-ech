# Hi there, I'm Adil 👋

I'm a software engineering student at [1337 School](https://1337.ma), part of the [42 Network](https://42.fr).  
I enjoy building things close to the metal — especially in **C** — and I'm passionate about understanding how software really works under the hood.

I’m always up for learning new concepts, contributing to open-source, or just tinkering with low-level code and system tools.
